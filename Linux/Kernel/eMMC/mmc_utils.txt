                To set enhanced attribute to general partition being created set
                 <enh_attr> to 1 else set it to 0.
                To set extended attribute to general partition
                 set <ext_attr> to 1,2 else set it to 0

        mmc_utils bootpart enable <boot_partition> <send_ack> <device>
                Enable the boot partition for the <device>.
                To receive acknowledgment of boot from the card set <send_ack>
                to 1, else set it to 0.

        mmc_utils bootbus set <boot_mode> <reset_boot_bus_conditions> <boot_bus_width> <device>
                Set Boot Bus Conditions.
                <boot_mode> must be "single_backward|single_hs|dual"
                <reset_boot_bus_conditions> must be "x1|retain"
                <boot_bus_width> must be "x1|x4|x8"

        mmc_utils bkops enable <device>
                Enable the eMMC BKOPS feature on <device>.
                NOTE!  This is a one-time programmable (unreversible) change.

        mmc_utils hwreset enable <device>
                Permanently enable the eMMC H/W Reset feature on <device>.
                NOTE!  This is a one-time programmable (unreversible) change.

        mmc_utils hwreset disable <device>
                Permanently disable the eMMC H/W Reset feature on <device>.
                NOTE!  This is a one-time programmable (unreversible) change.

        mmc_utils sanitize <device>
                Send Sanitize command to the <device>.
                This will delete the unmapped memory region of the device.

        mmc_utils rpmb write-key <rpmb device> <key file>
                Program authentication key which is 32 bytes length and stored
                in the specified file. Also you can specify '-' instead of
                key file path to read the key from stdin.
                NOTE!  This is a one-time programmable (unreversible) change.
                Example:
                  $ echo -n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHH | \
                    mmc rpmb write-key /dev/mmcblk0rpmb -

        mmc_utils rpmb read-counter <rpmb device>
                Counter value for the <rpmb device> will be read to stdout.

        mmc_utils rpmb read-block <rpmb device> <address> <blocks count> <output file> [key file]
                Blocks of 256 bytes will be read from <rpmb device> to output
                file or stdout if '-' is specified. If key is specified - read
                data will be verified. Instead of regular path you can specify
                '-' to read key from stdin.
                Example:
                  $ echo -n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHH | \
                    mmc rpmb read-block /dev/mmcblk0rpmb 0x02 2 /tmp/block -
                or read two blocks without verification
                  $ mmc rpmb read-block /dev/mmcblk0rpmb 0x02 2 /tmp/block

        mmc_utils rpmb write-block <rpmb device> <address> <256 byte data file> <key file>
                Block of 256 bytes will be written from data file to
                <rpmb device>. Also you can specify '-' instead of key
                file path or data file to read the data from stdin.
                Example:
                  $ (awk 'BEGIN {while (c++<256) printf "a"}' | \
                    echo -n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHH) | \
                    mmc rpmb write-block /dev/mmcblk0rpmb 0x02 - -

        mmc_utils cache enable <device>
                Enable the eMMC cache feature on <device>.
                NOTE! The cache is an optional feature on devices >= eMMC4.5.

        mmc_utils cache disable <device>
                Disable the eMMC cache feature on <device>.
                NOTE! The cache is an optional feature on devices >= eMMC4.5.
