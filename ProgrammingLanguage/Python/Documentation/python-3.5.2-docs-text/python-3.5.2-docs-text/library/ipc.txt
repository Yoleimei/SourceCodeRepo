Interprocess Communication and Networking
*****************************************

The modules described in this chapter provide mechanisms for different
processes to communicate.

Some modules only work for two processes that are on the same machine,
e.g. "signal" and "mmap".  Other modules support networking protocols
that two or more processes can use to communicate across machines.
